    <h2>Introduction of the Picture Sources</h2>
    <p>I took this picture three years ago, when I was an undergraduated student. This is the main street of the university and there are hundreds of ginkgo on the two sides of the street. When fall comes, their leaves become gold yellow and the landscrape is really fascinating. If the weather is suitable, there will be many people who come to sit on the ground to enojoy the peaceful time.</p>
